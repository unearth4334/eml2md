Hi Alice,

Thanks for organizing this. I'm available on Wednesday afternoon after 2 PM.

Tuesday is not good for me as I have client calls scheduled.

Looking forward to the meeting!

Bob

Hello team,

Both Tuesday and Wednesday work for me. I prefer Wednesday afternoon if that works for Bob as well.

I'll prepare the status report for our current milestones.

Regards,
Carol

Good morning all,

Wednesday afternoon works perfectly for me as well. Shall we say 2:30 PM in the conference room?

I can bring the technical documentation we've been working on.

Best,
Dave
